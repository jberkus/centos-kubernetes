# centos-kubernetes

This repository contains some demo scripts and files for quick & easy setup of a small Kubernetes cluster running on CentOS hosts.  It uses Kubeadm for install, and only creates a single-master (non-HA) cluster.  However, that's enough to get you started on trying out Kubernetes on an actual multi-node cluster, instead of just using minikube for testing.

Accompanying slides (such as they are) [here](http://jberkus.github.io/kube_on_centos/).
